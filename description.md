One of the most surprisingly simple tools to increase your productivity and reduce your stress is the todo-list. Too often, we're overwhelmed with how much we have to do, but by breaking down a complicated project into simpler tasks and then keeping a list of these tasks in the form of a todo-list, you end up getting more done in a calmer way. In fact, as you offload the job of remembering tasks from your active memory to a todo-list, you effectively reduce your stress levels and give yourself more control of your projects and life. This guide describes how to do this using Todoist, the todo-list app that works seamlessly across every device and platform and which has been praised as a life-changing app by The Guardian, USA Today, the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Lifehacker and more. Inside, you'll learn the best tips and techniques for using Todoist so you can start living the calmer, more productive and more organized life you've always thought you were capable of but never had the chance to achieve.
