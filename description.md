A surprisingly simple tool to increase your productivity, or just reduce your levels of stress while maintaining your productivity, is the simple todo-list. Breaking down a complicated project into simpler tasks, and breaking these down further, until each task is manageable is the first step in reducing the complexity of a project, and by keeping a written list of the tasks involved you are offloading the job of remembering the tasks from your active memory. Just writing down the tasks you need to do, in itself, can reduce your stress levels and make you feel more in control of your projects. This book describes the online tool Todoist, praised as a life-changing app by The Guardian, USA Today, the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Lifehacker and more, Todoist works seamlessly across 10+ different platforms in 20 languages so you can stay motivated and productive no matter where you are.
