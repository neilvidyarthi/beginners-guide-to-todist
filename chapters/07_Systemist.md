# Systemist: A workflow example

One of the hardest things about adopting a productivity tool isn’t learning to use the tool itself, but having a reliable productivity workflow. In this chapter, we want to introduce you to Systemist, a workflow developed by Amir over the past ten years.

## Why would you have a workflow?

A productivity workflow is a collection of patterns you use to organize yourself. In the beginning, adopting a workflow might feel strange, but after a while, it will be running on auto-pilot, and you will be able to focus on completing important tasks instead of managing them (or forgetting about them).

The truth is that our lives and the world we live in are too complicated to just wing things. A reliable system can help you prioritize the important things and juggle many things at once without feeling overwhelmed and stressed.

## Systemist

Systemist is a simplified workflow built for the modern world. Systemist works best with Todoist, given that the app is built the app around it, but it can work with most other productivity apps as well. The core principles are much more important than the tools.

Systemist has 6 simple components.

### 1) Take it everywhere
A productivity system is only useful if you can access it everywhere you are. Luckily Todoist has invested a ton of resources into making the service available everywhere. It’s recommended installing Todoist on every device you have (mobile devices, web browsers, email clients, desktops): [Todoist Apps](https://todoist.com/Help/Apps)

### 2) Capture everything
A productivity system is only useful if it captures all the important things going on in both your personal and professional life. Capturing everything gives you a lot of freedom to not stress that you will forget something important (for example, a follow-up with a client, buying a gift, etc.) It will also give you a complete overview of things you need to do.

Here are some of the things you can capture:

* Follow-ups you need to do, could be with external people or within our team.
* Complex projects that have many smaller steps.
* A shared shopping list with your partner.
* Emails you can’t answer them right away. You can use [Todoist for Gmail](https://todoist.com/gmail) or [Outlook](https://todoist.com/outlook).
* A shared release list with your colleagues.
* Recurring tasks to check up on long-term projects you are doing.
* Websites you can’t do right away. Could be adding an Amazon item you want to buy, adding an IMDB movie to your movie list, or saving articles to read later ([Todoist for Chrome](https://todoist.com/chrome)).
* A “Hiring” project of people you want to hire.
* Bug reports that are related to you.
* Health-related tasks (for example, weekly gym and running sessions).
* Etc.

Everything you need to do should be inside your system!

### 3) Break it up in small tasks and make them actionable
Small tasks are easier to complete than big ones, so break big tasks into a number of smaller sub-tasks that can be completed in 1 hour or less. This will allow you to estimate the total time involved more accurately. Plus, you’ll see progress as you check things off.

It’s also very important to make things actionable. You should be able to complete everything you have in your to-do list. Don’t keep items that you can’t or don’t plan to complete.

### 4) Prioritize
Todoist offers great tools to help you prioritize your days. Here’s how you can use these with Systemist:

* Use due dates to specify when you want complete something. Schedule a low priority task for the future. A high priority task could  be scheduled for today or tomorrow.
* Use Todoist’s priority levels to prioritize daily tasks. This is super useful in the daily/weekly views as Todoist will automatically put higher priority tasks first.
* Use labels to add even more prioritization. For example, you could use @high_impact label on tasks that will create a high impact. The great thing about label is that you can easily filter them across all of your projects

### 5) Get to to-do list zero daily
With Systemist you would want to use “To-do list Zero”. The idea was inspired by [Inbox Zero](http://www.43folders.com/izero), and it’s quite simple: At the end of the day, you want zero tasks on your today list.

The truth is that most days you won’t complete everything on your today list and you will most likely postpone things. No completing everything isn’t a negative thing; it’s an opportunity to take stock of where you are at, re-evaluate your tasks, and re-plan them.

“Todolist Zero” keeps the system tidy, up-to-date, and, most importantly, manageable.

### 6) Get consistent feedback
Most productivity systems only focus on what you need to do and not what you have done. Where’s the fun if you don’t celebrate progress and don’t get insights into how productive you are?

That’s why Todoist has [Todoist Karma](https://todoist.com/karma), a feedback system that gives you insights into your productivity and awards you for your accomplishments.

Todoist Karma tracks your progress, visualizes it and gives you points. As a beginner this system is quite fun, since there are also levels involved and you feel like you are progressing. Todoist Karma is like a mini game that makes task management a bit more fun and rewarding.

After you reach a certain level Karma becomes a bit boring. This is where goals and streaks kick in. You can set goals for the number of tasks you want to complete each day or week. For every goal you complete Karma will increase your streak. If you miss a goal one day, your streak gets reset to zero. This system is inspired by [Jerry Seinfeld’s Productivity Secret](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret).

## Managing emails
We recommend following [Inbox Zero](http://www.43folders.com/izero). For example:

* Only check emails twice per day. Once in the morning and once in the afternoon.
* In each session try to process all the emails.
* If you can, respond to an email right away. If you can’t turn it into a task with a due date and priority via Todoist for Gmail.
* Disable all notifications from your email client on all of you devices so you won’t be disturbed as you focus on other things.

## Managine chat
Slack and other chat apps can be a huge productivity killers, since they can interrupt you at any time. Studies have shown that the average desk job employee loses 2.1 hours a day to [distractions and interruptions](https://blog.todoist.com/2015/09/01/why-single-tasking-is-your-greatest-competitive-advantage-plus-19-ways-to-actually-do-it/). That adds up to over a full day of work every week! 

Here’s how you deal with these messaging services:

* Only be online when you want to be interrupted. Shut down these apps when you need to do focused work.
* Try process chat in batches. E.g. check chat apps a few times per day (maybe once an hour or so).
* Disable all notifications from chat apps on mobile. (if people need to reach you give them a phone number).

This workflow works nicely and lets you get some done without being interrupted all the time.

## Other workflows
Todoist is quite versatile and it works with most other workflows. Here’s some of them: 

* [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) [GTD]. There’s a guide you can follow [here](https://todoist.com/gtd) on how to get GTD inside Todoist.
* [Pomodoro with Todoist](https://support.todoist.com/hc/en-us/articles/210762349-Pomodoro-with-Todoist).
