# Basic features

In this chapter, we will go through the basic features available in a free Todoist account. For most users, these will suffice to increase your productivity, but for those of you who are looking for more, we examine the features available in a premium subscription in the next chapter.

## Tasks

If you have completed the default tasks you created when you signed up for your Todoist account (you do this by clicking on the circle to the left of the task title) or if you have simply deleted all of your tasks, you should have an empty list of today's tasks.

![Completing a task.](figures/completing-task.png)

![An empty Today's tasks list.](figures/clean-today.png)

This empty list is where you want to be at the end of each day, after you’ve completed all of your tasks. However, you will only be productive if you actually add some tasks first so you have something to mark as completed. A task list is only as effective as the tasks you choose to add.

To add a new task, you can click on the "Add task" link.

![Add task button.](figures/add-task-button.png)

This presents you with a field where you can write out the title of the task and select the date it should be completed. If you are in the *Today* view when you add the task, the completion date defaults to the current date; otherwise, the completion date will be empty.

![Add task.](figures/add-task.png)

You can also "quick add" a task using the keyboard shortcut Q. Here, you have the same options as if you add a task in the Today's list, but the task will, by default, be added to the *Inbox* list, even if you are currently looking at Today's list or a project, and the completion date will not be automatically set.

![Quick add task.](figures/quick-add-task.png)

Anyway, let us just add a task in the Today's list for now. Just type in a title for the task. Then hit **Enter**.

![Adding a task.](figures/adding-a-task.png)

After hitting **Enter**, you will have a new task open so you can continue adding more and more tasks. 

![](figures/after-adding-task.png)

You can just cancel the new task, either by clicking on **Cancel** or by hitting the **Esc** key. If you just added a single task, and you added it in the Today list, you should have a list that looks like this:

![](figures/after-adding-and-cancel.png)

When you write out the title of a task, Todoist will try to understand some of what you write and use it as meta-information. If you write something that can be interpreted as a date---like "today", "tomorrow", "next Sunday", "April 15"---it will interpret this and set your completion date as such. You can also add recurring due dates to your tasks like "every first of the month" or "every Monday".

You can add a time for a task as well as a date. To do this, just write a complete date as normal but follow it with "@" and then a time point. You can set the time from within the input text box or you can set it from the date scheduler.

![](figures/setting-due-time.png)

If you have successfully added a time as well as a date, you will see this when the task has been added.

![](figures/due-time.png)

If you want to put the task in a project---more on projects below---you can write a hash-tag and then the project name, e.g. `#Personal`.

### Setting task priorities

When you create a task, you can give it a priority by clicking on the flag to the bottom right of where you write the task title.

![](figures/select-priority.png)

This opens a small dialogue where you can select four different levels of priority.

![](figures/select-priority-2.png)

Since you are already typing in the task title, though, it's much easier to add a priority by typing "p1", "p2", "p3", or "p4" to pick the priority level.

### Rescheduling tasks

You don't necessarily want to schedule an end date for all tasks. Quite often, a project has many tasks and you don't necessarily want to schedule every single one right away. Some of the tasks have dependencies or are too distant to start scheduling. 

However, there will inevitably be times where you set a completion date for a task and when the date arrives, you haven’t managed to complete it. That leaves you with an overdue task.

![](figures/overdue-task.png)

If you click on the three dots to the right of the task title you open the menu for editing the task. In this menu there are a series of quick action buttons that allow you to reschedule the task to tomorrow, next week or next month. If you want a specific date, you can select the option “More”, whose icon is again the three dots.

![](figures/task-options-more.png)

Clicking there opens a calendar where you can reschedule the task.

![](figures/task-calendar.png)

Rescheduling a single task is relatively simple, but if you’re behind on a few projects you may have many overdue tasks, which isn’t as easy to reschedule. For this case, Todoist offers an AI-based rescheduling option. To the top-right of the list of overdue tasks, you can click on "Reschedule overdue".

![](figures/reschedule-overdue.png)

The first time you do this, you get a dialogue where you can get more information and where you can sign up to the service.

![](figures/reschedule-signup.png)

If you accept to use the AI, and any time after you have accepted it and click "Reschedule overdue", you will be presented with a list of suggested dates for your overdue tasks.

![](figures/reschedule-suggestions.png)

The reschedule suggestions will be based on your typical rescheduling patterns for project and kinds of tasks and will improve as the AI learns more about your work patterns.

### Creating tasks with sub-tasks

If you move your pointer to the left of a task title, you will see a handle for moving the task around, which works differently in different contexts.

![](figures/movement-handle.png)

In the *Today* task view, you can drag a task to the bottom of the list to postpone it to tomorrow.
In the *Next 7 days* task view, you can drag tasks to different completion dates. 

If you are in the *Inbox* view, or any of your specific projects, you can drag tasks between projects but you can also turn tasks into the subtasks of other tasks.

To make a task into a subtask, you can drag it in under the parent task and drag it slightly to the right to indent it. You can nest tasks and subtasks as deep as you want. Keep in mind that this only works in the *Inbox* or within a project view.

## Projects

Your list of projects is shown on the bottom left pane of the Todoist window.

![Projects list.](figures/todoist-projects.png)

These can be used to organise your tasks in a similar way to how you organise files in directories or photos in albums. You can have as many projects as you want and you can organise them into subprojects if you’d like. However, you probably shouldn't overthink the project organisation. If you have too many projects with too complex a structure, your todo lists become overly complex and difficult to navigate, and rather than assisting you in increasing your productivity, they begin to slow you down as you search for the project you need. It makes sense to use projects for long-term work; you’re probably better to use tasks and subtasks for work you will complete in a few weeks or a few months. Of course, experiment to find out what works best for you.

Your new Todoist account comes with a few sample projects already defined. You can add more by clicking on Add Project and you can edit or delete the existing projects by clicking on the three dots that appear when you move your pointer over a project title. We go into more detail below.

![](figures/edit-project.png)

From the menu, the two topmost menu items allow you to add a project adjacent to the currently selected project. However, it’s easy to move projects around and make projects into sub-projects using the handle that appears when you move the pointer over a project title. You can also use *Add Project* to create a project, then move it around as you like.

The next menu item, *Edit project* allows you to change the level at which a project is nested with the indent and un-indent buttons. You can also rename the project, or change the colour of the project by clicking the dot to the left of the project name.

There is also an item for sharing a project. If you select a project---by clicking on its title---you can also share it using the "person-plus" button at the top right of the task view window.

![Sharing a project.](figures/share-project.png)

We will return to sharing projects shortly.

The next two menu items, emailing tasks to a project and setting up a calendar feed, are premium features and covered in the next chapter. The last two menu items are two ways of getting rid of a project. You can archive it, and if you do you can get it back again by clicking on the *Archived projects* link below the projects list.

If you delete a project, it, and all its tasks, are permanently gone.

![](figures/archived-projects.png)

If you delete a project, it, and all its tasks, are permanently gone.

### Sharing a project

Sharing projects is a feature for collaboration. If you select a project, you can share it with someone else by clicking the share button.

![](figures/share-project.png)

To share with someone you need to know the email address they have used to set up their Todoist account or have shared a project with them earlier, in which case you can search for them by name. ^[If you have signed up using your Facebook or Google account, you need to have an email account associated with that account for sharing to work.]

![](figures/send-invitation.png)

If you click *Invite From Project* you can also get a list of people you have shared other projects with---if you have any such projects---and then invite all or a selected subset of participants from other projects.

After you invite someone, you will see them listed as collaborators, but *pending* until they accept the invitation.

![](figures/invitation-sent.png)

You will get a notification when an invitation is accepted.

![](figures/invitation-accepted.png)

A shared project is shown with a slightly different icon---a person instead of a circle---and with shared projects, you have the option of assigning people to different tasks.

![](figures/shared-project.png)

If you click on the assign icon, you can choose yourself or one of your collaborators as responsible for the task.

![](figures/assigning-a-task.png)

If you click on the *project comments* icon on the top of a shared project window you can start a project conversation.

![](figures/project-comments.png)

An actual project conversation is straightforward.

![](figures/project-comments-2.png)

## Filters

The final basic feature is *filters*. If you click on the *Filters* label on the right of the Todoist window you will get a list of your filters.

![Filters.](figures/filters.png)

It is possible to construct custom filters, but this is a premium feature, so we return to that in the next chapter. The basic filters you have available allows you to get a list of tasks assigned to yourself, assigned to anyone else, a list of tasks at each priority, all tasks whatsoever, and all tasks without a due date.

With just the basic account, filters are not as useful as they could be. Filters let you construct queries that work as smart projects, but to get use out of this you want to be able to add labels to tasks and construct filters based on them, and both these features are available only with a premium account.
