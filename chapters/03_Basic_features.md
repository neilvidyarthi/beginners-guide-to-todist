# Basic features

In this chapter we will go through the basic features available in a free Todoist account. For most users, these will suffice to increase your productivity using Todoist, but with a premium subscription you get extra features that we describe in the next chapter.

## Tasks

If you complete the default tasks you created when you signed up for your Todoist account---you do this by clicking in the circle to the left of the task title---or if you simply delete them, you should have an empty list of "Today's tasks".

![Completing a task.](figures/completing-task.png)

![An empty Today's tasks list.](figures/clean-today.png)

This is where you want to be at the end of each day, but of course you want to be able to add tasks to complete as well. Otherwise, it is easy to get an empty tasks list but absolutely useless as well.

To add a new task, you can click on the "Add task" link.

![Add task button.](figures/add-task-button.png)

This gives you a field where you can write the title of the task and the date it should be completed. If you are in the Today list when you add the task, the current date will automatically be inserted as the completion date; otherwise, the completion date will be empty. 

![Add task.](figures/add-task.png)

You can also "quick add" a task using the keyboard short-cut **Q**. Here, you have the same options as if you add a task in the Today's list, but the task will, by default, be added to the Inbox list, even if you are currently looking at Today's list or a Project, and the completion date will not be automatically set.

![Quick add task.](figures/quick-add-task.png)

Anyway, let us just add a task in the Today's list for now. Just type in a title for the task. Then hit **Enter**.

![Adding a task.](figures/adding-a-task.png)

After hitting **Enter**, you will have a new task open so you can continue adding more and more tasks. 

![](figures/after-adding-task.png)

You can just cancel the new task, either by clicking on **Cancel** or by hitting the **Esc** key. If you just added a single task, and you added it in the Today list, you should have a list that looks like this:

![](figures/after-adding-and-cancel.png)

When you write the title of a task, Todoist will try to parse some of what you write and use it as meta-information. If you write something that can be interpreted as a date---like "today", "tomorrow", "next Sunday", "April 15"---it will interpret this as the completion data and use it as such. You can also add recurring due dates to your tasks like "every first of the month" or "every Monday". If you want to put the task in a project---more on projects below---you can write a hash-tag and then the project name, e.g. `#Personal`.

### Setting task priorities

When you create a task you can give it a priority by clicking on the flag to the bottom right of where you write the task title.

![](figures/select-priority.png)

This opens a small dialogue where you can select four different levels of priority.

![](figures/select-priority-2.png)

Since you are already typing in the task title, though, you can much easier add a priority by typing "p1", "p2", "p3", or "p4" to pick the priority level.

### Rescheduling tasks

You don't necessarily want to schedule an end date for all tasks. Quite often, you have a large number of tasks for a project, and you want to get through them as the project progresses, but you don't necessarily want to schedule every single task---you will get to them when you get to them. Still, sometimes you have scheduled a task for a given date and yet haven't managed to complete it by that date. That leaves you with an overdue task.

![](figures/overdue-task.png)

If you click on the three dots to the right of the task title you open the menu for editing the task, and in this menu you can select the option "More" as the three dots there.

![](figures/task-options-more.png)

Clicking there, options a calendar where you can reschedule the task.

![](figures/task-calendar.png)

Rescheduling a single task is relatively simple and fast, but if you have somehow managed to get behind on a project or two, so you have many overdue tasks, you might not want to reschedule the tasks individually. If so, Todoist offers an AI-based rescheduling option. To the top-right of the list of overdue tasks you can click on *Reschedule overdue*.

![](figures/reschedule-overdue.png)

The first time you do this, you get a dialogue where you can get more information and where you can sign up to the service.

![](figures/reschedule-signup.png)

If you accept to use the AI, and any time after you have accepted it and click *Reschedule overdue*, you will be presented with a list of suggested dates for your overdue tasks.

![](figures/reschedule-suggestions.png)

The reschedule suggestions will be based on your typical rescheduling patterns for project and kinds of tasks and will improve as the AI learns more about your work patterns.

### Creating tasks with sub-tasks

If you move your pointer to the left of a task title, you will see a handle for moving the task around.

![](figures/movement-handle.png)

What you can do with this depends on whether you are in the *Today* or *Next 7 days* lists, or whether you are looking at a project or the *Inbox*. In the two completion-date based lists, you can move tasks between different dates but not anything else. If you are in the *Inbox* view, or any of your projects, you move tasks between projects and make some tasks subtasks of others. To make a task into a subtask, you should simply move it in under the super task. You can nest tasks and subtasks as deep as you want. Keep in mind, though, that you cannot do this in the *Today* and *Next 2 days* lists; you do need to be in *Inbox* or a project list.

## Projects

You have a list of projects shown on the bottom left of the Todoist window. 

![Projects list.](figures/todoist-projects.png)

These can be used to organise your tasks similar to how you organise files in directories or photos in albums. You can have as many as you want, and organise them into sub projects if you want to, but you probably do not want to overthink the projects organisation---if you have too many projects with too complex a structure, your todo lists becomes overly complex, and rather than assisting you in increasing your productivity, they slow you down as you have to keep your tasks organised. It makes sense to have a list of long-term projects you are working on; projects you will work on for a few weeks or a few months are probably better handled as tasks with subtasks---but find out what works well for you.

With a new Todoist account you have a few sample projects defined. You can add more by clicking on *Add Project* and you can edit or delete the existing projects by clicking on the three dots that appear when you move your pointer over a project title.

![](figures/edit-project.png)

The two topmost menu items you can use for inserting new projects, but you can alway just use *Add Project* as well and then move them around afterwards. You move projects around, and make projects into sub-projects, using a handle---similar to the tasks' handles---that appear when you move the pointer over a project title.

The next menu item, *Edit project*, is used to change the level at which a project is nested---which isn't different from what you can do just by dragging and dropping projects---and for changing the colour of a project.

After that, there is an option for sharing a project. If you select a project---by clicking on its title---you can also share it using the "person-plus" button at the top right of the window.

![Sharing a project.](figures/share-project.png)

We return to sharing projects shortly.

The next two menu items, mailing tasks to a project and setting up a calendar feed, are premium features and covered in the next chapter. The last two menu items are two ways of getting rid of a project. You can archive it, and if you do you can get it back again by clicking on the *Archived projects* link below the projects list.

![](figures/archived-projects.png)

If you delete a project, it, and all its tasks, are permanently gone.

### Sharing a project

Sharing projects is a feature for collaboration. If you select a project you can share it with someone else by clicking the share button.

![](figures/share-project.png)

To share with someone you need to know the email address they have used to set up their Todoist account or have shared a project with them earlier, in which case you can search for them by name.^[If you have signed up using your Facebook account, you need to have an email account associated with that account for sharing to work.] 

![](figures/send-invitation.png)

If you click *Invite From Project* you can also get a list of people you have shared other projects with---if you have any such projects---and then invite all or a selected subset of participants from other projects.

After you invite someone, you will see them listed as collaborators, but *pending* until they accept the invitation.

![](figures/invitation-sent.png)

You will get a notification when an invitation is accepted.

![](figures/invitation-accepted.png)

A shared project is shown with a slightly different icon---a person instead of a circle---and with shared projects you have the option of assigning people to different tasks.

![](figures/shared-project.png)

If you click on the assign icon you can choose yourself or one of your collaborators as responsible for the task.

![](figures/assigning-a-task.png)

If you click on the *project comments* icon on the top of a shared project window you can start a project conversation.

![](figures/project-comments.png)

An actual project conversation is fairly straightforward.

![](figures/project-comments-2.png)

## Filters

The final basic feature is *filters*. If you click at the *Filters* label on the right of the Todoist window you will get a list of your filters.

![Filters.](figures/filters.png)

It is possible to construct custom filters, but this is a premium feature so we return to that in the next chapter. The basic filters you have available allows you to get a list of tasks assigned to yourself, assigned to anyone else, a list of tasks at each priority, all tasks whatsoever, and all tasks without a due date.

With just the basic account, filters are not really that useful. Filters let you construct queries that work as smart projects, but to really get a use out of this you want to be able to add labels to tasks and construct filters based on them, and both these features require a premium account.
