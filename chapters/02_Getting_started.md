# Getting started

Todoist is an online service that works on 10+ platforms and syncs your tasks across them all. In this chapter, we get started by setting up your Todoist account and installing the Todoist apps that apply to you.

## Setting up a Todoist account

To set up a Todoist account, you go to http://www.todoist.com. If this is the first time you visit the site, the front page will look like the picture below. To set up an account, you should click the "Get Started - It's Free" button.

Clicking the button will take you to a sign-up form. Here, you can use an existing Google or Facebook account to create your Todoist account, or you can type in an email address and a password.

If you sign up using a Google or Facebook account, you need to give Todoist permission to access your credentials from those services, and after that, you can log into Todoist using them. If you sign up using an email address, you just need to remember the password you provide to be able to log in later.

Regardless of how you chose to sign up, you will be sent to a signup wizard. Click the "Let's Go" button to get started.

The first choice you get to make during sign up is the theme Todoist will use when it shows you your todo-lists. You can choose whatever color you'd like, and don’t worry if you change your mind, you can always choose a new color later.

After that, you will be asked to add a task for today.

Just type anything here---it is just used as an example, so it isn't so important what you choose.

Your third choice is to add a daily task. Daily are tasks that will be added to your todo-list each day---if you complete them, they will be added again the next day, if you do not complete them, they are moved to your overdue tasks but not added again for each day.

Since the task is just there as an example of repeated tasks, you can write anything and delete it later.

After that, you are done with the sign-up. You can choose to subscribe to the Todoist blog if you’re interested in productivity tricks and news about Todoist or you can choose not to subscribe.

Clicking the "Finish" button will send you to the main Todoist interface where you can see all your projects and tasks.

## The basic interface

This interface shows you a list of projects on the left---there are some default projects already defined when you sign up, but you can always change them.

![Your Todoist projects.](figures/todoist-projects.png)

If you click on any of the projects, you will be shown the tasks associated with the selected project. Right now, though, none of the projects has any tasks associated---you are being shown the two tasks you created when signing up as part of today's tasks and these are part of the special project "Inbox".

There are three useful task views that are not directly associated with projects: Your Inbox, your tasks for today, and your tasks for the next seven days. You can pick between these three views at the upper left of the window.

The Inbox is where tasks are put by default. It behaves like a project, but it isn't intended as one. Think of it as a place where you put tasks during the day to sort them into appropriate projects at a later point. This separates the job of adding tasks from organising your todo-list. The "Today" and "Next 7 days" folders should be self-explanatory.

When you have just logged in for the first time, you are shown the tasks for today. The tasks are listed at the right of the window.

![Your tasks for today.](figures/todoist-tasks.png)

If you move your cursor to the right of a task, three dots will appear.

If you click on the three dots, a drop-down menu appears. You can use this menu to edit tasks.

You can, for example, use the menu to assign a task to a project. Just click "Move to another project", and a list of your projects appear.

![](figures/editing-tasks-3.png)

You can also choose to delete a task from this drop-down menu.

If you want to get rid of the daily task that you added when you signed up in, this is the place to do it. If you just complete it, which you can do by clicking the circle to the left of the task, it will disappear from today's tasks but reappear tomorrow. If you delete it, you get rid of it.

## Native apps

In many cases, working with Todoist through your web browser is a convenient choice, but if you are on the road and not always online, you might want to install it as a native app, where you can work with Todoist offline. You can get apps for different platforms by going to https://en.todoist.com/downloads. There are desktop apps for MacOS and Windows, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and even wearable apps for iWatch and Android Wear. On the same page, you can get browser extensions for integrating Chrome, Safari, or Firefox with Todoist---making it easy to turn web pages into tasks. You can also get plugins for integrating Outlook or Gmail with Todoist, making it easy to translate emails into tasks.
