# Integrations

Todoist integrates with hundreds of different apps and enables to get an overview of all your tasks and get a complete control of your life. In this chapter, we’ll briefly look at various integrations and how you can utilise them to become more organised and productive. You can find a full list on [Todoist’s integrations page](https://todoist.com/integrations).

## Mail integrations

People spend [28% or more of their work emailing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-leadership/post/how-much-time-you-really-spend-emailing-at-work/2012/07/31/gJQAI50sMX_blog.html). Spending some energy on becoming better at emailing can probably save you much time.

Use [Todoist for Gmail](https://todoist.com/gmail) or [Todoist for Outlook](https://todoist.com/outlook) to easily add emails as tasks and manage your to-do list directly from your email client. When you add emails as tasks, you keep your inbox clean and have the ability to add due dates, reminders, and priorities to your emails (and see them with all the other tasks you have). We recommend that you use the [Inbox Zero workflow](http://www.43folders.com/izero) in combination with the Todoist plugin.

## Browser extensions

Todoist’s browser extensions let you add any website as a task and manage your todo-list without leaving the site you are visiting.

You can use this to keep track of articles you want to read, books that are interesting, an Amazon.com shopping list, or even a tweet you want to respond to later.

Install [Todoist for Chrome](https://todoist.com/chrome) or [Todoist for Firefox](https://todoist.com/firefox) and get started easily.

## Speak to your personal assistant

Todoist integrates directly with Alexa or Google Assistant and lets you easily add tasks from anywhere in your home by just speaking. Many people find this integration to be pure science-fiction, and it works surpassingly well.

For example, you can just say “Alexa, add pick up the kids tomorrow at 2 pm to my todo-list”, and Alexa will add a task with a due date and a reminder to your Todoist project.

Learn how to start to use [Todoist for Alexa](https://blog.todoist.com/2016/10/13/todoist-alexa-integration/) or [Todoist for Google Assistant](https://blog.todoist.com/2016/12/16/todoist-google-assistant/).

## Time tracking using Toggl

In many professions, people are required to track the time they spend on each task for each particular client. Luckily, Todoist integrates with [Toggl](https://blog.todoist.com/2014/10/16/track-your-task-time-inside-todoist-with-toggl/), one of the most popular time tracking services. The Toggl integration enables you to easily keep track of how much time you are spending on your tasks.

## Automate your life using IFTTT and Zapier

Todoist integrates with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), some of the most popular automation tools. These automation tools enable you to create incredibly complex workflows between hundreds of different apps.

To give you an idea of how powerful this is let's look at an example. Let’s say you are a surfer and you would like to get reminded a day before the waves are going to be good. How would you solve this? Well, an easy way is to connect Surfline and Todoist on IFTTT. You can create an applet that adds a task to your #Surf project a day before the surf will be good at your local surf spot! The likelihood of you being a surfer isn't high, but hopefully, you get the point of how powerful this is.

Zapier even supports [multi-step workflows](https://zapier.com/blog/workflow-automation/) involving many apps, including very powerful Todoist workflows. 

It's only your imagination that sets a limit on what things you can automate and integrate with each other.
