# The Beginner's Guide to Todoist

We live in a busy age where everyone has lots of projects they work on in parallel, both through work and in their personal lives, and it can be overwhelming or downright stressful to keep track of all we want to achieve. A surprisingly simple tool to increase your productivity, or just reduce your levels of stress while maintaining your productivity, is the simple todo-list. Breaking down a complicated project into simpler tasks, and breaking these down further, until each task is manageable is the first step in reducing the complexity of a project, and by keeping a written list of the tasks involved you are offloading the job of remembering the tasks from your active memory. Just writing down the tasks you need to do, in itself, can reduce your stress levels and make you feel more in control of your projects.

Keeping your todo-lists on scraps of paper has its drawbacks, however. It is easy to forget to bring the list with you everywhere you go; updating it means you have to rewrite it on a new piece of paper; you can lose the list, or destroy it in the wash. Electronic todo-list managers are therefore an attractive choice. [Todoist](www.todoist.com) is a prime contender in the market of online todo list managers, its basic features are free, you can use it via the web or using apps for a large selection of platforms, and it integrates with more than 50 online services. This booklet is an introduction to Todoist that will guide you through setting up an account, manage projects and tasks on your todo-list(s), and integrate the use of Todoist in your daily workflow.
