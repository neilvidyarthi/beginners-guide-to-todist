# Premium features

The basic features you have with a free Todoist account suffices for most users of Todoist, but with a premium subscription, you get extra features that enhance the user experience. We describe these features in this chapter. If you are not interested in having a premium subscription, you can skip to the next chapter.

## Labels

Labels provide an alternative and orthogonal way of organising your tasks. You can use projects to organise your tasks, so related tasks are grouped together, but tasks often have different relationships depending on how you look at them. Some are related because of their due date or priority, aspects you can explicitly specify for all tasks. Some are related because they belong to the same overall project, which is what the projects handle. Others are related for example because of where you must be to handle tasks---at home, at the office, out shopping---or how much effort it will take to handle them---some tasks you might need to dedicate several hours to, to get into flow, while others you can handle whenever you have a few minutes free. These kinds of tasks can be grouped using labels.

You can get the list of labels you have associated with your tasks by clicking *Labels* to the right of *Projects* to the left of the Todoist window.

![](figures/labels.png)

In the example shown here, labels are used to tasks that must be performed at home, at the office, and/or when sitting at a computer, tasks that can be handled when there is a little bit of free time ("no brainers"), so we have a list of tasks to do when there is a break between meetings but not time enough to get deep into a project, and then a label for organising travels, where some planning might be needed ahead of time.

You can explicitly define which labels you want to use---just click *Add Label* for each category you want---but you can also define a new label when you add a task to Todoist. When you write the title of a task, say in a "quick add" bar, you can type "@" to start adding a label. After that, just type the label you want to associate with the task. You will be able to autocomplete on existing labels, but you can add a new one this way as well.

![](figures/quick-adding-task-with-label.png)

After adding a label, the label will be highlighted in the task description.

![](figures/quick-adding-task-with-label-2.png)

You can add as many labels as you want.

Incidentally, projects can be associated with tasks the same way, just using "#" instead of "@". Just press "#" and type a project name. Again, you can autocomplete on an existing project or type a new project name and create the project when you add the task.

![](figures/quick-adding-task-with-label-and-project.png)

![](figures/quick-adding-task-with-label-and-project-2.png)

If you move your pointer over a label name, you see three dots that you can use to bring up a menu for a label. All you can really do with labels is delete them or edit them.

![](figures/edit-labels.png)

The only thing you can "edit" about labels, though, is the colour associated with them.

## Filters

With a premium subscription, you can turn filters into a much more powerful by customising them. With a basic subscription, you are stuck with the ones that are already defined, but with a premium subscription you can add new filters and use them to show tasks matching a query. You can use the query language described [in the Todoist manual](https://support.todoist.com/hc/en-us/articles/205248842-Filters) and filter on labels, projects, priority and due dates. Below we show an example where we define a filter for upcoming travels. We specify a query that matches all tasks with the `@travels` label and that are due within the next 30 days. The tasks matching the query are shown in the list on the right.

![](figures/custom-filters.png)

## Reminders

With a premium subscription, you can also get reminders from Todoist. There are three different types of reminders: automatic reminders, explicit reminders, and location reminders.

Automatic reminders are used when you assign a time as well as a date to a task. If you do, you will receive a reminder about the task 30 minutes before the due date. You can change the default time by going to *Settings* and then *Reminders*.

![](figures/settings.png)

![](figures/reminder-settings.png)

How you receive reminders depend on the platform, you are on. If you only use the web version of Todoist, you will need to set up text messages or emails to make sure you get a notification, but if you set up Todoist on a mobile device---iOS or Android---you can get notifications there and ensure you never miss a reminder.

Automatic reminders will handle many common tasks, but receiving a reminder 30 minutes---or whatever you choose in your settings---might not be optimal for tasks that you might have to worry about days before their deadlines. When the automatic reminder does not suffice, you can set reminders explicitly.

When you are adding a task to Todoist, you can click on the alarm clock under the task title to set a custom reminder.

![](figures/setting-reminders.png)

This opens up a field where you can specify a reminder. There is a drop-down selection that is set as a clock by default. With this option selected, you can specify a date and a time for a reminder.

![](figures/setting-time-reminders.png)

![](figures/setting-time-reminders-2.png)

After setting a reminder, you will automatically open a field for adding another one. Press **ESC** to abort the next reminder to finish adding reminders, or type in as many as you want.

![](figures/setting-time-reminders-3.png)

A task with reminders associated will be shown with an alarm clock icon to the right of its title.

![](figures/setting-time-reminders-4.png)

If you have a mobile device with Todoist on it, you can also use location awareness to set up reminders when you enter or when you leave a location.

To set up a location reminder, you need to add a reminder as before, but you should click the watch icon to change the reminder from being associated with a given time to being associated with a location.

![](figures/selecting-location-reminder.png)

For the actual location, you need to type in an address. You can also specify whether you want the reminder when you arrive at the location, or when you leave.

![](figures/selecting-location-reminder-2.png)

Once you have added a reminder, you will automatically start making another, and again you can press **ESC** to finish adding them.

![](figures/selecting-location-reminder-3.png)

If you want a location reminder with a location you have used before, you can click the icon to the right of the address field and select a recent location.

![](figures/selecting-location-reminder-4.png)

## Comments and file uploads

You can add additional information to both projects and tasks using comments. You can get access to project comments by clicking the dialogue icon next to a project title.

![](figures/project-comments-premium.png)

You can then write a text as a comment, upload a file, or add a recording.

![](figures/adding-project-comment.png)

![](figures/adding-project-comment-2.png)

Files you upload will be shown together with text comments.

![](figures/adding-project-comment-3.png)

Project comments are also how you can communicate with your collaborators in a shared project.

You can add task comments by clicking on the dialogue icon next to a task title---if there are no comments associated with a task, you will need to move your pointer there before the icon appears. 

![](figures/task-comment.png)

Adding a comment to a task works just as adding a comment to a project.

![](figures/adding-task-comment.png)

![](figures/adding-task-comment-2.png)

The number of comments added to a project or a task will be shown next to their comment-icons.

![](figures/adding-task-comment-3.png)

## Integration with mail and calendars

Also available as premium features are integration with mail and calendars. You can access these features inside a project view by clicking on the tools icon to the right of the project title, or from the project list menu on the left.

![](figures/project-settings.png)

![](figures/project-settings-2.png)

The mail integration gives you an email address that you can use to add tasks to a project via emails. Sending emails to this address will construct a task in the project. You can specify priorities, labels, and dates from the subject or body of the email.

![](figures/email-integration.png)

Adding tasks via emails might not seem that useful compared to just adding tasks directly to Todoist, but it is a convenient way of making tasks out of emails: you can forward emails to relevant Todoist projects and add meta information in the forwarded email's body. Attachments and the forwarded email will be added as comments to the task you create this way.

Calendar integration gives you a calendar feed you can subscribe to. Tasks in a project you subscribe to will be shown, on their due dates, in your calendar program if you do this.
