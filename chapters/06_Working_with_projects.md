# Working efficiently with your Inbox and your projects

The goal of using a todo list to keep track of your daily tasks is to increase your productivity, but there is an overhead involved: organising your tasks. If you leave all your tasks in one big pile, it becomes a mess that doesn't help you, but on the other hand, it also takes time to organise the tasks into projects. It's ideal to have a process to be as efficient as possible when it comes to organizing your tasks.

During a busy day, there are likely to be many tasks you think of or are asked to do and your instinct would be to put these tasks on your todo list before you forget about them. However, you may not have the time and shouldn't necessarily organise the tasks at the same time as you add them to your list. It takes some effort to figure out whether these tasks are part of a project, which priority the tasks have and when you need to have them done. You can't necessarily make those decisions if you're in the middle of some important work, and too much thinking would break the flow of what you are doing. You don't want to let the todo list become a burden rather than a boon.

What you want to do is to add tasks as soon as you think of them, but make it a daily task to organise them when you have time. Perhaps you could set aside half an hour at the end of the day, or ten minutes in the morning over your coffee, to go through new tasks and organise them. In Todoist, the *Inbox* is there to assist you with this. Whenever you think of a new task, add it to the Inbox project and don't worry about organizing the task any further. Instead, set some time aside each day to go through the Inbox and organise the new tasks there.

Some tasks are easier to organize than others. Some tasks obviously belong in certain projects, like a grocery list. Some, obviously, have higher priorities than others. Some have deadlines that you have to meet. Overall, organising different tasks and adding tasks to your todo list requires varying levels of mental effort. That's why you need a great Inbox process.

## Using your Inbox

Every time you think of a task, add it to your Inbox project. Small or large, important or not, large task or small, it doesn't matter. Just keep adding everything you can think of when you think of it, day in, day out. What you want to do is to offload the effort your brain uses in remembering future tasks to your todo list. If you are anything like us, you probably have tasks running around your brain constantly reminding you about their existence, regardless of how important they are. You may be in a constant state of not wanting to forget anything that *might* be important. This is where a todo list can be a life saver. As soon as you think of a task, add it to your todo list, and stop spending brain power thinking about it.

Of course, writing down tasks doesn't mean that you have achieved them, so there is an important second step if you want to stop worrying about forgetting important tasks. You have to keep them organised and make sure that you accomplish them. Organising the tasks is the important second step---actually doing the tasks is a third, and much more important, step, but that will follow from organising the tasks properly.

So now that you have all your tasks in your Inbox, when you go through the tasks at the end of the day or the next morning, you have separated recording your tasks from the act of organising them. You'll find that the organisation becomes less of a burden, and it might even become enjoyable. This is a lot better than constantly breaking your workflow. 

In short, record everything and don't worry about---at this time---how important or how trivial a task is. Just record it. Then, once a day, go through your Inbox and evaluate each task.

So how do you organize tasks?

Just go through each task. The first question you want to ask yourself is whether the task is worth doing or not. During a busy day, every task seems important, but in actuality, not all tasks are. Some, when you think about them away from the heat of the moment, can just be deleted. The are not important after all. Some, on the other hand, you still want to do, but they are not important to do right now---you don't want to forget about them, but there is not need to worry about them just yet. Put those in a "later" project and look at that folder once in a while to see which tasks are still worth keeping, which tasks are actually important and need to be moved to a more prominent place, and what tasks should be deleted because they just aren't important any longer.

When you go through your Inbox, you will find many tasks that belong to obvious projects. Those, you can move there. But don't just move them there; take some time to think about how important they are for that project. Give the tasks a priority. Don't worry too much about the priority you give to tasks---you can always change them, after all---but a rough idea about how important a task is will help you organise a project down the line.

Some tasks do not necessarily belong to an obvious project. Those tasks are harder to organise. Fortunately, you have time to think about this since you are looking at them at during your "organising time". You don't have to make quick decisions. Figure out to which project they matter most, or consider whether they indicate that you need to create a new project to assign them to. You don't want too many projects---that makes organising your tasks harder---but if you find that there are tasks that keep popping up, that seem related, it is a good indication that you might want to create a new project to organise them into.

As you go through the tasks, you might want to give them all a deadline, so you don't forget about them. That is not necessarily a good idea. If we record that a task should be done by tomorrow, we give it more importance tomorrow than it necessarily has. We just tend to give deadlines more importance than the actual impact of tasks for a project. Many deadlines we give for tasks at the spur of the moment are completely arbitrary anyway---don't give tasks deadlines unless they are hard deadlines force upon you from external forces. Priorities are a better way to measure how important tasks are, but if you give even low priority tasks a deadline, you will tend to value the deadlines over the priorities.

Now, you might fear that if you don't give a task a deadline, which means they won't pop up on your Today list at any time, you will forget about them. That might be true, but if you never get to a task because there are always more important tasks---tasks with a higher priority---then you will often be making the right choice to work on the highest priority item. However, you should revisit your lists every once in a while to make sure to see whether any tasks in waiting now need a deadline or a priority boost. Just make sure you give them deadlines because the deadlines matter; not because you feel like completing them or so you don't forget about them.

Unless a task has a hard deadline, don't assign one to it. Give it a priority and assign it to a project. You will go back to each project regularly anyway and evaluate the tasks there.

## Working with your projects

How you work with projects will be somewhat subjective. You have to evaluate regularly how important each project is to you. That is, of course, influenced by both external and internal factors, by work and family and by your personal goals. Regardless how important individual projects are, they are the highest level at which you want to organise your todo list. A high priority task in one project might be less important than a low priority task in a more important project. And how high a priority you give to a given project will vary from day to day---personal projects matter more in your time off than work projects while work projects are what you want to focus on during work hours.

A productive way to work with your todo list is to set aside time to work on individual projects rather than individual tasks. Deadlines might determine which projects you should be working on at any particular day---which is why we recommend that you don't put deadlines on tasks that are not hard deadlines---but more often, the importance of the actual project is what drives your work any individual day. If you set aside a fixed amount of time to work on each project during a day or a week then you simply will do the most important work for a given project at the time you set aside to work on that project. Use your calendar to set aside time to work on your important projects---that isn't something you want to use a todo list to do---and at the time you have set aside for a project, check out the most important tasks in that project. That is where your priorities will save you a lot of time -- you can dive right into the task instead of thinking about what to work on first.

Of course, priorities change over time, so don't get too settled with the priority you give a task when you move it from your Inbox to a project. Priorities are always relative to all other tasks in a project, and once in a while, you want to go through your projects to reevaluate the priorities you have assigned to your tasks. If you want to work efficiently on a project, you can't just attack one task at a time---you also need to take the time to evaluate how important other tasks are and whether you want to attack them in groups. And you have to update those priorities regularly.

Taking time from accomplishing tasks to organise tasks might feel counterproductive, but you don't want to spend time on working on irrelevant tasks when more important tasks are ignored. That might *feel* productive, but in the long run, it isn't. To *be* productive, you have to set time aside to evaluate the importance of your tasks from time to time. How often you want to do this depends on your projects. Projects you work on every day, you probably want to look over once a week; other projects, once a month; other projects still, once a year. It all depends on how often you decide on which next task to work on. You want to look over your projects regularly enough that you are reasonably certain that any given task you work on is still important for the project.

## Breaking down tasks

To work efficiently with your todo list, you need to break down your tasks into manageable bites. Tasks such as "design a homepage", "write a report" or "implement an algorithm" might be clear enough, but they are rarely easy to get started on. When you go through your projects to evaluate the tasks in them, ask yourself this question for each of them: Is this a task I know how to get started on? If you don't see what the next step is for a given task, it probably is too abstractly defined---you want to break it down into more manageable pieces. At the very least, you want to figure out what the first step of such a task would be.

Part of keeping a project organised is breaking down tasks into manageable bits that you can attack. Ideally, you want a session working on a project to consist of picking off the next task, completing it, and then moving to the next. You cannot do this if you first have to figure out what each task consist of; which subtasks you have to complete to deal with the task.

It is not that important if you spend time breaking down tasks into manageable sub-tasks during the time you have set aside to work on a project or during the time you have set aside for organising your project. What is important is that you actually do it so you can work efficiently with your todo list. If the tasks you put in your list are abstract and difficult to start, you will feel lost when you move from one task to another. Whenever you have an unmanageable task, take some time to figure out how it can be split into subtasks that are more easily done.
